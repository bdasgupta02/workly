# Workly

*Your handy project management buddy!*

## Our Story

**Motivation**

For most student groups and small teams which are embarking on a project, they often lack the necessary tools for effective project management. They mostly rely on chat platforms because the common enterprise-level managment tools are expensive to implemenet and are meant for larger teams. 

**Solution**

Our aim is to combine the simplicity of a chat platform with the effectiveness of collaboration tools to significantly better manage small-scale projects, through a mobile platform.
